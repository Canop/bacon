### next
- new `allow_failures` job parameter - Fix #99
- `rerun` internal bound by default to F5 - Fix #105

<a name="v2.4.0"></a>
### v2.4.0 - 2023/01/12
Major feature:
The global prefs.toml and the local bacon.toml file now have the same properties, the local bacon.toml overriding the global prefs.toml file. Among the consequences: you can have a list of default global jobs; you can set a different preferences (eg wrapping, summary, etc.) for a specific repository. The default configuration files and the recommended best practices are unchanged - Fix #101

<a name="v2.3.0"></a>
### v2.3.0 - 2022/12/30
- doesn't launch job when the modified file is excluded by gitignore rules - Fix #32

<a name="v2.2.8"></a>
### v2.2.8 - 2022/12/15
- remove double-dash from default run configuration - Fix #96

<a name="v2.2.7"></a>
### v2.2.7 - 2022/12/14
- capture output of "should panic" tests - Fix #95

<a name="v2.2.6"></a>
### v2.2.6 - 2022/12/08
- fix a compilation problem - Fix #94

<a name="v2.2.5"></a>
### v2.2.5 - 2022/10/08
- fix wrong scrollbar in several cases of wrapping

<a name="v2.2.4"></a>
### v2.2.4 - 2022/10/05
- fix inability to scroll to last line sometimes

<a name="v2.2.3"></a>
### v2.2.3 - 2022/09/17
- fix a compilation problem on Window - Thanks @Stargateur - Fix #87

<a name="v2.2.2"></a>
### v2.2.2 - 2022/08/28
- define a new `allow_warnings` job setting. When it's true, the job is considered successful even when there are warnings. This is default on the `run` job, which means the `cargo run` output is displayed even when there are warnings - Fix #81
- allow `cargo --prefs` to be ran from outside cargo projects - Fix #84

<a name="v2.2.1"></a>
### v2.2.1 - 2022/05/12
- update some dependencies

<a name="v2.2.0"></a>
### v2.2.0 - 2022/05/12
- Locations exported in .bacon-locations now made absolute so that IDE plugins don't have to know the package's root
- job cancelling now works on unresponsive jobs too. This is a quite heavy change as the current implementation involves bringing in async and it's not 100% clean but it solves a major problem, further improvements could be welcome - Fix #78 - Thanks @nolanderc
- you can refer to cargo aliases by prefixing jobs with `alias:`, either when setting up keybindings, defaults, or when launching bacon. Example: `bacon alias:q` to launch the cargo task aliased as `q` - Fix #77

<a name="v2.1.0"></a>
### v2.1.0 - 2022/03/26
Major feature:
The `export-locations` argument (shortened in `-e`) generates a `.bacon-locations` file which can be used by IDE plugins.
A plugin has been made for neovim: [nvim-bacon](https://github.com/Canop/nvim-bacon) and other ones would be welcome.

Minor changes:
- wrapping now applies to all outputs, even non interpreted ones like the output of `cargo run`.

<a name="v2.0.1"></a>
### v2.0.1 - 2022/02/18
- fix summary of warnings counted as warning

<a name="v2.0.0"></a>
### v2.0.0 - 2022/02/16
Major features:
- It's now possible to configure key bindings in the prefs.toml file. Those key bingings can trigger internal actions (scrolling, toggling, quitting) or jobs (for example you can launch `cargo test` on the `t` key. - Fix #52
- help page, listing all key-bindings
- a job is said to be *successful* when there's no error, test failure or warning. When a job is successful, its output is displayed by bacon. This makes it possible to have a `cargo run` job, for example.
- it's possible to define an *action* to run when a job is successful. For example you can launch a `cargo doc --open` job on a key, and have bacon switch to the previous job with the `on_success = "back` trigger so that you don't open a browser page on every change
- arguments given after `--` are given to the job - Fix #67
- there's a web documentation site now, you should have a look: https://dystroy.org/bacon

Minor changes:
- fix character being lost behind scrollbar on wrapping
- replaced argh with clap for launch arg parsing. The `--help` presentation is thus different. `bacon -h` now supported.

<a name="v1.2.5"></a>
### v1.2.5 - 2022/01/29
- fix missing output of "no_run" doctests - Fix #64
- restrict naming of jobs to [\w-]+ regex (you were unlikely to use other chars due to the TOML format anyway)

<a name="v1.2.4"></a>
### v1.2.4 - 2021/11/27
- fix inability to deal with some inter-member dependencies on Windows - Fix #59 - Thanks @jDomantas

- fix wrong version number in bacon.log

<a name="v1.1.4"></a>
### v1.1.4 - 2021/02/10
It's possible to define directories to watch in the bacon.toml config file. For example, by default the `test` job watches the `tests` directory if it exists - Thanks @SafariMonkey

<a name="v1.1.3"></a>
### v1.1.3 - 2021/01/29
* `check-all` target now checks all - Fix #27

<a name="v1.1.2"></a>
### v1.1.2 - 2021/01/05

<a name="v1.1.1"></a>
### v1.1.1 - 2021/01/03
Don't consider test fails as command fails (ie display the count of test fails in `bacon test` instead of command error)

<a name="v1.1.0"></a>
### v1.1.0 - 2020/12/26
