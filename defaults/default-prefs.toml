# order is reversed, and the status bar is on top
#
# reverse = true

# The grace period is a delay after a file event before the real
# task is launched and during which other events will be ignored.
# This is useful if several events are often sent quasi-simultaneously
# (eg your editor backups before saving, then renames).
# You can set it to "none" if it's useless for you.
#
# grace_period = "5ms"

# Uncomment and change the value (true/false) to
# specify whether bacon should show a help line.
#
# help_line = false

# Uncomment and change the value (true/false) to
# set whether to display the count of changes since last job start
#
# show_changes_count = false

# Uncomment one of those lines if you don't want the default
# behavior triggered by a file change. This property can also
# be set directly in a specific job.

# Exports can be executed either
# - on each job completion (if auto is true)
# - or called on a key (eg `ctrl-e = "export:analysis"`)
#
# They can be used for communication with external tools
# or for inquiries.
#
# Exporting "locations" (by setting its 'auto' to true) lets you use
# them in an external tool, for example as a list of jump locations
# in an IDE or in a language server.
# (See https://dystroy.org/bacon/config/#export-locations),
#
# Possible line_format parts:
#  - kind: warning|error|test
#  - path: complete absolute path to the file
#  - line: 1-based line number
#  - column: 1-based column
#  - message: description of the item
#  - context: unstyled lines of output, separated with escaped newlines (`\\n`)
