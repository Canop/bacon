**Bacon** is developed by **Denys SÃ©guret**, also known as [Canop](https://github.com/Canop) or [dystroy](https://dystroy.org).

Major updates are announced on my Mastodon account: [@dystroy@mastodon.dystroy.org](https://mastodon.dystroy.org/@dystroy).

The logo has been designed by [Peter Varo](https://petervaro.com).

# Sponsorship

**Bacon** is free for all uses.

If it helps your company make money, consider helping me find time to add features and to develop new free open-source software.

# Chat

The best place to chat about bacon, to talk about features or bugs, is the Miaou chat.

[Bacon room on Miaou](https://miaou.dystroy.org/4683?bacon)

# Issues

We use [GitHub's issue manager](https://github.com/Canop/bacon/issues).

Before posting a new issue, check your problem hasn't already been raised and in case of doubt **please come first discuss it on the chat**.

Looking into an issue may require bacon to be launched with log enabled (eg `BACON_LOG=DEBUG bacon`) which produces a `bacon.log` file.

If bacon didn't understand correctly the output of a cargo tool, it may also be useful to have a look at the analysis export, which you normally find in a `bacon-analysis.json` file on hitting `ctrl-e`.

# Contribute

If you think you might help, as a tester or coder, you're welcome, but please read [Contributing to my FOSS projects](https://dystroy.org/blog/contributing/) before starting a PR.


**Don't open a PR without discussing the design before**, either in the chat or in an issue, unless you're just fixing a typo. Coding is the easy part. Determining the exact requirement and how we want it to be done is the hard part. This is especially important if you plan to add a dependency or to change the visible parts, eg the launch arguments.
